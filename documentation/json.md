# JSON

>Note:
A note on AJAX — JSON is often used with AJAX, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
AJAX is used to transfer data without having to refresh the browser page


JSON saved in a ```.json``` file. JSON files consist of a series of key/value pairs.
```javascript
{ "key": "value" }
```

### Data Types
The following data types can be used with JSON:
```javascript
strings (in double quotes)
numbers
objects
arrays
Booleans (true or false)
null
```



### JSON.stringify()
The ```JSON.stringify()``` function converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string. 
**Strings** are **lightweight** and therefore **very useful** when transporting data from a client to a server.
