### PUG

Pug, formerly known as “Jade” is a high performance and feature-rich **templating engine** that’s easy to achieve.
Pug is a clean, white space/indentation sensitive syntax for writing html.

It provides the ability to write dynamic and reusable HTML documents, its an open source HTML templating language for Node.js (server-side JavaScript), totally free to use and provides fast, easy, and fun HTML.

Pug works with indentation or white spaces.

During the time Pug is compiling the .pug file to plain HTML, the compiler throws build errors if the indention in your file isn’t correct.

##### Installation

   $ npm install pug –g
