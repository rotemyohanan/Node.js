### Env variables:

   process.env - holds all the environment variables
    
Process is a global object.

### Creating a new env variable:

    1) export HEY='heyy!!!'
    2) process.env.whatever = 'this is the value of the whatever key'

    
    process.env.NODE_ENV
    
    
index.js inside node means the same as index.html
When require a directory in a file it will directly fetching the index.js of that specific directory.
